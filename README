######README FILE for AST.pl########################################################################
######Release 0.4 version###########################################################################

1.put AST.pl script under a directory in the Linux
2.download the NCBI taxonomic dmp files ("nodes.dmp" and "names.dmp") from ncbi taxonomy directory (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/taxdump.tar.gz) and put these two files in the same directory as that of AST.pl
2.$chmod u+x AST.pl  #change the privilege of this perl script
3.usage: 
./AST.pl -h
it will display the help page.

Input:
(1) File "non_redundant_hits_file" is the file contains the information of all relevant sequences from which you would like to sample.
(2) m: pls specify the number of sequences you would like to sample

Note that all input files should be in the same directory.

#File format for "non_redundant_hits_file":
It should be composed of four columns as follows:
column 1: gi number
column 2: NCBI taxonomy id; 
	  #Note: you could find the taxonomy id corresponding to each gi from:
	  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/gi_taxid_prot.zip  For proteins
	  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/gi_taxid_nucl.zip  For nucleotide sequences
column 3: score;
	  This score should reflect the similarity level between this hit sequence and the query. The higher score, the more similar. For example, bitscore of blast search will be a suitable choice. Note that E-value is not acceptable.)

Output two result files and one intermediate file :
(1) out.$m.sample  : the id list of sampled sequences
(2) out.$m.taxon2m : a statistics to indicate how many sequences sampled from the corresponding taxonomy
(3) cal.process: contains intermediate values and process of calculation for being used in test.

For example, to sample 15 sequences from the "test" file into "Test_Result" directory, pls type the command line as:
"./AST.pl -u 1 -l 1 -o Test_Result -f test -m 15".
